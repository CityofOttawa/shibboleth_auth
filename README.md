shibboleth_auth
===============

Java adapter for shibboleth 2.x based on the Shibboleth Drupal Login Handler found here: https://drupal.org/project/shibboleth_drupalauth.

This version includes the entityID as part of validation requests and allows for decision making on a users behalf when processing a session token.  Users can then be sent to somewhere other than the default login location.
